# Project Happy Thoughts API

In this backend project I'm using Express and MongoDB to build an API that I will connect to an older frontend project made by myself. This is the first time I will produce a fullstack product. The API includes both GET request endpoints to return data, POST request endpoints to create data and PATCH request endpoints to modify data. The API is connected to my old frontend project, Happy Thoughts.

The API creates the backend to a friendly happy Twitter, where users can post their happy thoughts in a feed (latest 20 thoughts is in the feed).

## The problem

I approached the problem by following the code from the lectures, to have as a base. Then I modified it. I made a Google Jamboard and a kanban board to plan the project.

For this project I used these technologies; JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Postman, nodemon, Google Cloud, REST API, JSON, Google Jamboard & Kanban board.

If I had more time I would've loved to add categories/tags to the thoughts.
