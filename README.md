# Project Happy Thoughts API

In this backend project I'm using Express and MongoDB to build an API. The API includes both GET request endpoints to return data, POST request endpoints to create data and PATCH request endpoints to modify data. I'm connecting my API to an old frontend project, Happy Thoughts.
